# This is Project AstraÂ®!

Hi! This is Project Astra, a web-tv app created by Salvemini Vibes and developed by Cristiano Bleve (@tsocricri on github)

### What is Project Astra?
Project Astra was born from an idea to simplify the way we view our audio-visual content.

### What is Salvemini Vibes?

Born at the end of 2021 in Alessano, in the province of Lecce, **Salvemini Vibes** is the first totally Scholastic WebRadio in Salento (Southern Apulia, Italy) that is part of the Secondary Education Institute called 'Gaetano Salvemini'.

Our institute offers many scholastic addresses to take inspiration from for a future life, both working and personal, that puts the education of children first. All this in an environment that does not limit them but rather spurs them on to do more by letting them do what they like best!

The link to our institute's website is [this one](https://www.salveminialessano.edu.it).
